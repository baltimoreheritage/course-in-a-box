# Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

## What is Explore Baltimore Heritage 101?

**Explore Baltimore Heritage 101** is an online course to teach people how to research and write about local history created by Baltimore Heritageâ€”a nonprofit preservation advocacy organization in Baltimore, Maryland. We created this course using the [Jekyll Course template from P2PU](http://github.com/p2pu/jekyll-course-template). If you have any questions or suggestions for this project, please get in touch with Eli Pousson as <a href="http://twitter.com/elipousson">@elipousson</a> on Twitter or at pousson@baltimoreheritage.org.

## Who is Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 for?

We created this course to support the efforts of people interested in the history of Baltimore's historic buildings, neighborhoods and communities. We often work with students, volunteers and community activists who want to better understand and share the story of how their community has developed and changed over time. The lessons and exercises in this course are intended to supplement the direct coaching and training that Baltimore Heritage staff already does.

## What is the goal of Explore Baltimore Heritage 101?

Our goal is to teach these research and writing skills to more people and encourage more contributions to our Explore Baltimore Heritage project and our related initiatives including the Battle of Baltimore and exhibits for the Baltimore Heritage Digital Collections site.
