# What is this Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course?

This course is designed as a tutorial for local historians, students, educators and others who are interested in contributing research, writing, or images to Explore Baltimore Heritage. We cover everything from how to write story on a topic that interests you or even how to work with a group of students to develop an entire tour. Key components of this course include an explanation of how stories and tours are organized, guidelines for composing and formatting stories and suggestions for how to submit stories for publication.

The course is split in four modules: **research**, **writing**, **visuals** and **publication**.

Each module includes suggested projects, readings and other related **resources** to help you.

## Work at your own pace, but not alone!

This is a self paced course. You may want to start at the beginning and work through each lessons until the end. Alternatively, you may want to jump around depending on your interest and experience. For example, if you are already an experienced researcher, you may want to start with our module on writing.

**Doing the course at your own pace does not mean that you have to do the course on your own.** We encourage anyone who is taking this course to share your experiences, questions and more on the [Bmore Historic Facebook group](http://facebook.com/groups/bmorehistoric/). Here you can ask any question, share your work or other interesting readings and meet other local historians and preservationists.
