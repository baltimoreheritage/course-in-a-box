# Images

## How do I select images?
A good selection of contemporary and historic images can be a very effective complement to the written description. Each story requires a minimum of 1 image before it may be published. Appropriate images may include:

- An overall view of the place or building
- Photographs of architectural details or interior spaces
- Portraits of any related individuals
- Excerpts of historic maps showing the place in context

## How do I caption images?

- At a minimum, caption should include information on the subject, photographer, and date, e.g. Photograph of the Bromo Seltzer Tower by Eli Pousson, May 1, 2011.
- Extended captions can be used to provide additional context on some aspect of the story.

- Captions **should not exceed 100 words**.

## How do I credit photographs?

- Caption should be followed by an image credit with the collection, archive and ID number, e.g. Image courtesy BG&E Collection, Baltimore Museum of Industry, BGE.4441.
- The caption and credit should be separated by a hard return.

## How do I format images?

- Use Picasa or Photoshop Elements or another image editing application to resize to 1000px on the widest side at 72dpi, save as a JPEG.
- The image filesize should be between 40Kb to 200Kb
- Images may be attached to an email, sent through a shared Dropbox folder, or by using a file transfer service like [http://www.sendspace.com](http://www.sendspace.com/) to transfer a ZIP file with any images.

## How do I submit images with my story?

All images should be formatted and emailed with a completed Image Log. A template for the image log can be found be here: [Image Log Template](https://docs.google.com/a/baltimoreheritage.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArOjWKXcXXQXdEw1QUFIVW5mNF9lODBkbXdlcDU2ZXc#gid=0).(Click File and Download As Microsoft Excel.) Images can be bundled with stories in one of the following ways:
- A collection of JPEG files both submitted as email attachments along with a completed image log and story.

- A shared folder or link to download a ZIP file with similar materials as described above.

- Please _do not_ embed images with Word Documents!

## How do I complete the Image Log?
