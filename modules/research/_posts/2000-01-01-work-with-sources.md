# Lessons 3: How to work with sources

With these skills in mind, we walk through a list of sources that you can use for your local history research including:

- Secondary Sources
- Periodicals
- Maps
- City Directories
- Census Records
- Public Documents
- Oral Histories
- Moving Images & Audio Recordings
- Photographs
- Manuscript Collections

We focus on sources that are available digitally. 

## 3.1: Skills for Sources

The lesson begins by introducing two important skills that you need to think about sources:

- How to find sources
- How to read closely
- How to evaluate sources


### How to find sources

### How to read closely

Close reading is the skill of evaluating sources and analyzing the language and rhetoric they use:

- What claims does the author make? 
- What evidence does the author use? 
- What language (words, phrases, images, symbols) does the author use to persuade the document's audience?
- How does the document's language indicate the author's perspective?

These questions help you consider about whether you can trust the author’s claims or rely on the same evidence they use. Thinking about language helps you to read between the lines and explain what the implicit meaning of the source may be.

### How to evaluate sources 

Sourcing asks students to consider who wrote a document as well as the circumstances of its creation. Who authored a given document? When? For what purpose?  This poster reminds students before reading a document to ask:
  
- Who wrote this?   
- What is the author’s perspective?   
- Why was it written?   
- When was it written?  
- Where was it written?  
- Is this source reliable? Why? Why not?

Different resources are available to help you evaluate different types of sources. For example, many scholarly histories (a secondary source) are reviewed after publication — can you find a review of the book you are reading? Reviews might point out errors, omissions or other issues that you should consider.

## 3: Secondary Sources

If you're starting a new local history research project, **secondary sources** such as books and articles about the history of Baltimore (many of which can be found through or [Google Books](http://books.google.com/)) or **reference materials (sometime known as tertiary sources)** (like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)) are often a great place to begin.

**Google Books** covers a wide range of primary and secondary sources and you never know what you might turn up.

Sometimes another scholar or researcher has already written about your area of interested or a related area. Browse through these secondary sources to find more information or use the bibliographies to find even more.

### How to evaluate secondary sources

- What else has the author written?
- Are there any reviews of the book? 

### How to write a historiography

### How to find secondary sources 
  

## Understanding your sources

Physical v. digital
Limits of digital archives

## Reading newspapers

Historic newspapers are another great place to start but require more experience to use most effectively. Anyone with a library card from the Enoch Pratt Free Library can access the a database of historic newspapers

### Baltimore Sun

### Afro-American

## Public Documents & Census Records

**Immigration, Enlistment, and other Public Records**
If you have a name of a resident, a property owner, or a business, you can find more information using historic directories or the range of public records, including immigration records, enlistment and veterans records, and census records, available through a commercial services like Ancestry.com.

**Census**
County and state level census data can also provide a broader perspective on the demographics of our region. Find digitized directories, census materials in [our digital sources directory](http://baltimoreheritage.org/resources/digital-sources-for-local-history-research/ "Digital Sources for Local History Research").

**Deed**
You can often find the names of prior owners and resident of your house by finding the prior deeds and tracing a chain of title. [Learn more in our guide to deed research.](http://baltimoreheritage.org/resources/how-to-research-the-chain-of-title-for-your-historic-property/ "How to research the chain of title for your historic property")

## Maps

Maps are often helpful for identifying when buildings and landscape features are built and when they disappear. They often also include place names, names of property owners, as well as information on transportation and infrastructure.

## Photographs

Historic photographs can help you identify how a place has changed over time. Pictures are also a great way of getting anyone interested in learning more about local history.
