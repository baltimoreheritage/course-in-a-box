## Who are you?

We're [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/), a citywide historic preservation advocacy nonprofit in Baltimore, Maryland. We share local history through projects, programs, and partnerships including:
[Explore Baltimore Heritage](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/),
[Baltimore 1814](http://1814.baltimoreheritage.org/), and
[Northeast Baltimore History Roundtable](http://baltimoreheritage.org/partners/northeasthistory/). 
We like to experiment with using the web to help save historic places, celebrate local history and build a stronger, and more inclusive sense, of community identity for Baltimore neighborhoods. This new online course was started by [Eli Pousson](https://github.com/elipousson/), Director of Preservation & Outreach.
